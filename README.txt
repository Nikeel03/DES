• Each experiment_i.m file is numbered according to its outcome and ready to run with inputs in hexadecimal form for convenience. 

• experiment_1: Import the generatesubkeyQ1.m file, which serves as the designated function for Outcome 1.

• experiment_2: Import the generatesubkey.m file, which serves as the designated function for Outcome 2.

• experiment_3_4and6: These experiments utilize the DEA.m function and the generatesubkey.m function. The same applies to experiment_5and6. The plaintext, key, and ciphertext used for comparison are included and referenced. Additional validity checks involving  encryption and decryption with other sources were discussed in the report using this code.

• experiment_7: This experiment comprises two sections that can be run together to observe the Avalanche effect. A singular bit change can be seen alongside the drastically different ciphertext. Refer to the report for an in-depth discussion.

• experiment_8: Displays frequency distribution plots discussed in the report. All ciphertext was computed using experiment_3_4and6.
